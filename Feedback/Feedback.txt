R1 - The presentation was good. Team showed confidence and they were well
prepared. Work done upto R1 was less however. More work could have been
accomplished. Team did not come up with their own solution however and were
content to go along with the clients request which was to replicate existing
product. 51/55 

R2 - Presentation shows good progress in work. Though the client bailed out,
the team tried to complete all the work on their own which was good and kept in
touch with the client themselves.  
and solutions for the project.
